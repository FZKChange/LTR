# LTR(Long-Tailed Recognition)
ðŸ˜ŠThis file is mainly used to document papers on long tail recognition and track some of the latest research findings.

ðŸ˜ŠClass-imbalance (also known as the long-tail problem) is the fact that the classes are not represented equally in a classification problem, which is quite common in practice. For instance, fraud detection, prediction of rare adverse drug reactions and prediction gene families. Failure to account for the class imbalance often causes inaccurate and decreased predictive performance of many classification algorithms. Imbalanced learning aims to tackle the class imbalance problem to learn an unbiased model from imbalanced data. **Link:** https://github.com/ZhiningLiu1998/awesome-imbalanced-learning
